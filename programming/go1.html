        <h1>Go1 Software Package</h1>
        <h2>Programming and Software Development</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The Go1 Software Package is a modular, high-level control framework developed for Unitree robots. Designed at the DiCE Lab at San Diego State University, this framework bridges robotics, Building Information Models (BIM), and Unity-based simulations, simplifying mission planning and enabling seamless integration with sensors, edge devices, and APIs. The system includes a construction-specific implementation for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using machine learning, enhancing trust in human-robot collaboration through real-time inference and explainability. The system and the research paper that I co-authored can be found on my GitHub page at this link: <a href="https://github.com/nthPerson/UnitreeGO1-HRI-BIM" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As a research assistant at the DiCE Lab, I contributed to the development and implementation of this project, and I was the primary author for the Explainable AI (XAI) feature for HAR. My responsibilities included designing core components of the Python backend, integrating client-server communication, and enhancing transparency through natural language explanations generated by OpenAI's GPT model.</p>

        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Explainable AI Feature:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed the <code>explain_processor.py</code> module to generate detailed explanations of activity inferences.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a pipeline that gathers inference data, including video frames and model outputs, and uses OpenAI's API to provide natural language explanations.</li>
                    <li>Enabled traceability by saving generated explanations alongside auto-labeled data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed a modular Python backend with TCP-based client-server communication.</li>
                    <li>Facilitated real-time data exchange between Unity, the Python backend, and the robotic vehicle.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>BIM and Unity Integration:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leveraged BIM data for pathfinding and mission planning in Unity.</li>
                    <li>Enabled high-fidelity simulation of the robot's environment to facilitate a wide variety of applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dataset Scarcity:</strong> Construction-specific HAR datasets are limited. To address this, I helped develop a self-labeling mechanism that dynamically generates labeled data during HAR, demonstrating the potential for semi-supervised learning to streamline dataset creation.</li>
            <li><strong>Explainability in AI:</strong> Increasing transparency is crucial to promoting trust in human-robot collaboration. By integrating the OpenAI API, I ensured that the system could generate clear, context-aware explanations for all inferences made during HAR.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcome and Impact</h3>
        <p>The Go1 Software Package enhanced accessibility of robotics for non-experts by simplifying sensor integration and customization. It improved human-robot collaboration through real-time HAR and explainable AI. Additionally, the open-source availability of the package supports adoption and customization by researchers across various industries.</p>
