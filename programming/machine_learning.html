        <h1 class="text-center">Machine Learning Implementations</h1>
        <p>This project is a collection of machine learning models that I developed during my time as a student in CS 549 Machine Learning at San Diego State University. It includes implementations of various machine learning techniques, ranging from foundational models like linear and logistic regression to advanced architectures like transformers and convolutional neural networks. Each model was implemented with a focus on understanding the underlying principles, and many were implemented from first principles using Python and NumPy. Additionally, I optimized these implementations to run on GPU-enabled systems, significantly improving computational efficiency.</p>
