        <h1>Mobile Payment System Mounting Solution</h1>
        <h2>Industrial Problem Solving</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This project involved designing and manufacturing a custom mount to integrate a mobile payment terminal with an iPad case. Commissioned by Go Rentals, an elite vehicle rental company operating at over 140 locations nationwide, the solution allowed staff to accept credit card payments efficiently and securely as clients disembarked from private aircraft. The project required innovative problem solving, from prototyping to scaling production, and exemplifies my ability to address technical challenges in real-world industrial applications.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I was responsible for end-to-end development, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conducting stakeholder consultations to define project requirements.</li>
            <li>Designing and prototyping the mount using CAD and 3D printing.</li>
            <li>Managing production and optimizing the manufacturing process to deliver 400 units within established time constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design and Prototyping:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used CAD software to create a durable, functional, and visually appealing design that met stakeholder requirements.</li>
                    <li>Prototyped the mount with 3D printing and refined it based on feedback from Go Rentals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturing Optimization:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GCODE Optimization:</strong> Modified GCODE files to enhance 3D printer productivity while maintaining high-quality standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automation with Python:</strong> Wrote scripts to automate repetitive processes, reducing manual intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precision Techniques:</strong> Developed a reliable method for embedding fasteners into the printed mounts to ensure durability and ease of assembly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Production Scaling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scaled up production on a single 3D printer by optimizing print times and implementing efficient workflows.</li>
                    <li>Delivered three production batches: one initial order of 200 units and two subsequent orders of 100 units each.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scaling Production:</strong> Producing 400 high-quality units with limited resources and time.
                <ul>
                    <li>Solution: Streamlined the manufacturing workflow, automated processes, and optimized printer calibration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Maintaining Precision:</strong> Ensuring consistent quality across all units while increasing production speed.
                <ul>
                    <li>Solution: Fine-tuned the 3D printer and implemented innovative techniques for embedding mechanical components.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Balancing production demands with my responsibilities as a student.
                <ul>
                    <li>Solution: Efficiently managed time by automating tasks and prioritizing the most effective optimizations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcome and Impact</h3>
        <p>Delivered all units on time and exceeded Go Rentals' expectations for quality and durability. Improved the payment process for Go Rentals staff, enabling smoother operations in high-demand settings. Gained valuable experience in scaling manufacturing processes and solving complex industrial challenges, which provided insights into parallels with scaling software systems.</p>
