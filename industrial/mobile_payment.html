        <h1 class="text-center">Mobile Payment System Mounting Solution</h1>
        <p>This project involved designing and manufacturing a custom mount to integrate a mobile payment terminal with an iPad case. Commissioned by Go Rentals, an elite vehicle rental company operating at 220 locations nationwide, the solution allowed staff to accept credit card payments efficiently and securely as clients disembarked from private aircraft. The project required innovative problem solving, from prototyping to scaling production, and exemplifies my ability to address technical challenges in real-world industrial applications.</p>
