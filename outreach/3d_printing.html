        <h1 class="text-center">Miramar Ranch Elementary 3D Printing Outreach Program</h1>
        <p>At the request of a computer science professor at San Diego State University, I developed and led a hands-on 3D printing and CAD design workshop for over 200 4th and 5th grade students at Miramar Ranch Elementary School. This outreach initiative aimed to engage students with STEM through interactive learning while addressing the underutilization of 3D printers in school libraries. The program served as a proof of concept for integrating 3D printing into elementary education and helped inspire the next generation of STEM learners.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Presenting educational materials and guiding young students through customization activities in a limited amount of specially-allocated time in the students' school day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Polished the presentations and tested the activities prior to live performances of the workshop.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Student Engagement:</strong>
                <ul>
